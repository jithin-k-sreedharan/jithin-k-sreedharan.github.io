    My central research interest is in solving real-world problems in data science with a network perspective. I mostly
    follow a multifaceted approach of problem solving: theoretical modeling, designing and analyzing low complexity
    algorithms, and verifying it on real-world data. My research focus on data mining algorithms for large networks with
    probabilistic guarantees, statistical modeling and inference on networks, and distributed techniques for analyzing
    big network matrices. I am also interested in application of machine learning to various inference problems on
    networks, and, in general, stochastic modeling of complex systems.

In temporal ordered clustering, given a single snapshot of a dynamic network, we aim at partitioning its nodes into $K$ ordered clusters $C_1 \prec \cdots \prec C_K$ such that for $i &lt;j$ nodes in cluster $C_i$ arrive to the dynamic graph before nodes in cluster $C_j$. The problem of inferring evolution of a dynamic network is of considerable significance in many applications ranging from predicting the age of proteins to track the expansion of fake news in online social networks. We first formulate our problem for a general dynamic graph, and propose an integer programming framework that finds the optimal partial order, which describes the clusters achieving the best precision (i.e., fraction of successfully ordered node pairs in the partial order) for a particular density (i.e., fraction of comparable node pairs in the partial order). We provide a method to solve a linear programming relaxation of the original optimization using importance sampling on a Markov chain corresponding to the graph evolution. Inspired by this solution, we design unsupervised and supervised algorithms to find temporal ordered clusters. Finally, we instantiate our model to the duplication-divergence model (also known as the vertex copying model) which turns out to present a real challenge when compared to other network models, as explained in the paper. We validate the proposed algorithms tailored to the duplication-divergence model on synthetic data and various real-world networks.

          We take an information-theoretic approach to identify nonlinear feature redundancies in unsupervised learning.
          We define a subset of features as sufficiently-informative when the joint entropy of all the input features
          equals to that of the chosen subset. We argue that the rest of the features are redundant as all the
          accessible information about the data can be captured from sufficiently-informative features. Next, instead of
          directly estimating the entropy, we propose a Fourier-based characterization. For that, we develop a novel
          Fourier expansion on the Boolean cube incorporating correlated random variables. This generalization of the
          standard Fourier analysis is beyond product probability spaces. Based on our Fourier framework, we propose a
          measure of redundancy for features in the unsupervised settings. We then, consider a variant of this measure
          with a search algorithm to reduce its computational complexity as low as \(O(nd)\) with \(n\) being the number
          of
          samples and \(d\) the number of features. Besides the theoretical justifications, we test our method on
          various
          real-world and synthetic datasets. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
          state-of-the-art feature selection techniques.

          Graph models often give us a deeper understanding of real-world networks. In the case of biological networks
          they help in predicting the evolution and history of biomolecule interactions, provided we map properly real
          networks into the corresponding graph models. In this paper, we show that for biological graph models many of
          the existing parameter estimation techniques overlook the critical property of graph symmetry (also known
          formally as graph automorphisms), thus the estimated parameters give statistically insignificant results with
          respect to the observed network. To demonstrate it and to develop accurate estimation procedures, we focus on
          the biologically inspired duplication-divergence model, and the up-to-date data of protein-protein
          interactions of six species including human and yeast. Using exact recurrence relations of some prominent
          graph properties, we devise a parameter estimation technique that provides right order of number of
          symmetries, and use phylogenetically old proteins as the choice of seed graph nodes. We also find that our
          results are consistent with the ones obtained from maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). However, the MLE
          approach is significantly slower than our methods in practice.

          The problem of reverse-engineering the evolution of a dynamic network, known broadly as network archaeology,
          is one of profound importance in diverse application domains. In analysis of infection spread, it reveals the
          spatial and temporal processes underlying infection. In analysis of biomolecular interaction networks (e.g.,
          protein interaction networks), it reveals early molecules that are known to be differentially implicated in
          diseases. In economic networks, it reveals flow of capital and associated actors. Beyond these recognized
          applications, it provides analytical substrates for novel studies - for instance, on the structural and
          functional evolution of the human brain connectome. In this paper, we model, formulate, and rigorously analyze
          the problem of inferring the arrival order of nodes in a dynamic network from a single snapshot. We derive
          limits on solutions to the problem, present methods that approach this limit, and demonstrate the methods on a
          range of applications, from inferring the evolution of the human brain connectome to conventional citation and
          social networks, where ground truth is known.

          Inferring the node arrival sequence from a snapshot of a dynamic network is an important problem, with
          applications ranging from identifying sources of contagion to flow of capital in financial transaction
          networks. Variants of this problem have received
          significant recent research attention, including results on infeasibility of solution for prior formulations.
          We present a new formulation of the problem that admits probabilistic solutions for broad classes of dynamic
          network
          models. Instantiating our framework for a preferential attachment model, we present effectively computable and
          practically tight bounds on the tradeoff curve between optimal achievable precision and density/recall. We
          also present
          efficient algorithms for partial recovery of node arrival orders and derive theoretical and empirical
          performance bounds on the precision and density/recall of our methods in comparison to the best possible. We
          validate our methods
          through experiments on both synthetic and real networks to show that their performance is robust to model
          changes, and that they yield excellent results in practice. We also demonstrate their utility in the context
          of a novel application
          in analysis of the human brain connectome to draw new insights into the functional and structural organization
          and evolution of the human brain.

          Many networks in the real world are dynamic in nature: nodes enter, exit, and make and break connections with
          one another as time passes. Several random graph models of these networks are such that nodes have
          well-defined arrival times. It is natural
          to ask if, for a given random graph model, we can recover the arrival order of nodes, given information about
          the structure of the graph. In this work, we give a rigorous formulation of the problem in a statistical
          learning framework
          and tie its feasibility, for a broad class of models, to several sets of permutations associated with the
          symmetries of the random graph model and graphs generated by it. Moreover, we show how the same quantities are
          fundamental
          to the study of the information content of graph structures. We then apply our general results to the special
          cases of the Erd˝os-R´enyi and preferential attachment models to derive strong inapproximability results.

        <div class="collapse" id="csn2018">
          In the framework of network sampling, random walk (RW) based estimation techniques provide many pragmatic
          solutions while uncovering the unknown network as little as possible. Despite several theoretical advances in
          this area, RW based sampling techniques
          usually make a strong assumption that the samples are in stationary regime, and hence are impelled to leave
          out the samples collected before the burn-in period. This work proposes two sampling schemes without burn-in
          constraint
          to estimate the average of an arbitrary function defined on the network nodes, for e.g. the average age of
          users in a social network. The central idea of the algorithms lies in exploiting regeneration of RWs at
          revisits to an aggregated
          super-node or to a set of nodes and in strategies to enhance the frequency of such regenerations either by
          contracting the graph or by making the hitting set larger. Our first algorithm, which is based on
          Reinforcement Learning
          (RL), takes advantage of the regeneration of RWs, and it uses stochastic approximation to derive an estimator.
          This method can be seen as intermediate between purely stochastic Markov Chain Monte Carlo iterations and
          deterministic
          relative value iterations. We study this method via simulations on real networks and observe that its
          trajectories are much more stable than those of standard random walk based estimation procedures, and its
          error performance is
          comparable to that of respondent driven sampling (RDS) which has a smaller asymptotic variance than many other
          estimators. The second algorithm, which we call the RT estimator, is a modified form of RDS that accommodates
          the idea
          of regeneration. Simulation studies show that the mean squared error of RT estimator decays much faster than
          that of RDS with time.

          Because of the significant increase in size and complexity of the networks, the distributed computation of
          eigenvalues and eigenvectors of graph matrices has become very challenging and yet it remains as important as
          before. In this paper we develop efficient
          distributed algorithms to detect, with higher resolution, closely situated eigenvalues and corresponding
          eigenvectors of symmetric graph matrices. We model the system of graph spectral computation as physical
          systems with Lagrangian
          and Hamiltonian dynamics. The spectrum of Laplacian matrix, in particular, is framed as a classical
          spring-mass system with Lagrangian dynamics. The spectrum of any general symmetric graph matrix turns out to
          have a simple connection
          with quantum systems and it can be thus formulated as a solution to a Schr\"odinger-type differential
          equation. Taking into account the higher resolution requirement in the spectrum computation and the related
          stability issues
          in the numerical solution of the underlying differential equation, we propose the application of symplectic
          integrators to the calculation of eigenspectrum. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated
          with numerical
          simulations on real-world networks of different sizes and complexities. </div>

          Are Online Social Network (OSN) A users more likely to form friendships with those with similar attributes? Do
          users at an OSN B score content more favorably than OSN C users? Such questions frequently arise in the
          context of Social Network Analysis (SNA)
          but often crawling an OSN network via its Application Programming Interface (API) is the only way to gather
          data from a third party. To date, these partial API crawls are the majority of public datasets and the synonym
          of lack
          of statistical guarantees in incomplete-data comparisons, severely limiting SNA research progress. Using
          regenerative properties of the random walks, we propose estimation techniques based on short crawls that have
          proven statistical
          guarantees. Moreover, our short crawls can be implemented in massively distributed algorithms. We also provide
          an adaptive crawler that makes our method parameter-free, significantly improving our statistical guarantees.
          We then
          derive the Bayesian approximation of the posterior of the estimates, and in addition, obtain an estimator for
          the expected value of node and edge statistics in an equivalent configuration model or Chung-Lu random graph
          model of

          In this paper we address the problem of finding top $k$ eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of
          symmetric graph matrices in networks in a distributed way. We propose a novel idea called complex power
          iterations in order to decompose the eigenvalues
          and eigenvectors at node level, analogous to time-frequency analysis in signal processing. At each node,
          eigenvalues correspond to the frequencies of spectral peaks and respective eigenvector components are the
          amplitudes at those
          points. Based on complex power iterations and motivated from fluid diffusion processes in networks, we devise
          distributed algorithms with different orders of approximation. We also introduce a Monte Carlo technique with

          We explore the dependence structure in the sampled sequence of complex networks. We consider randomized
          algorithms to sample the nodes and study extremal properties in any associated stationary sequence of
          characteristics of interest like node degrees,
          number of followers or income of the nodes in Online Social Networks etc, which satisfy two mixing conditions.
          Several useful extremes of the sampled sequence like $k$th largest value, clusters of exceedances over a
          threshold,
          first hitting time of a large value etc are investigated. We abstract the dependence and the statistics of
          extremes into a single parameter that appears in Extreme Value Theory, called Extremal Index (EI). In this
          work, we derive
          this parameter analytically and also estimate it empirically. We propose the use of EI as a parameter to
          compare different sampling procedures. As a specific example, degree correlations between neighboring nodes

          This paper considers cooperative spectrum sensing algorithms for Cognitive Radios which focus on reducing the
          number of samples to make a reliable detection. We propose algorithms based on decentralized sequential
          hypothesis testing in which the Cognitive
          Radios sequentially collect the observations, make local decisions and send them to the fusion center for
          further processing to make a final decision on spectrum usage. The reporting channel between the Cognitive
          Radios and the
          fusion center is assumed more realistically as a Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with receiver noise.
          Furthermore the communication for reporting is limited, thereby reducing the communication cost. We start with
          an algorithm where
          the fusion center uses an SPRT-like (Sequential Probability Ratio Test) procedure and theoretically analyze
          its performance. Asymptotically, its performance is close to the optimal centralized test without fusion
          center noise.
          We further modify this algorithm to improve its performance at practical operating points. Later we generalize

          for discrete alphabet. Their performance and asymptotic properties are studied theoretically. Later these are
          extended to continuous alphabets. Their performance with two well known universal source codes, Lempel-Ziv
          code and KT-estimator
          with Arithmetic Encoder are compared. These algorithms are also compared with the tests using various other
          nonparametric estimators. Finally a decentralized version utilizing spatial diversity is also proposed and
          analysed.

          We consider nonparametric sequential hypothesis testing when the distribution under null hypothesis is fully
          known and the alternate hypothesis corresponds to some other unknown distribution. We use easily implementable
          universal lossless source codes
          to propose simple algorithms for such a setup. These algorithms are motivated from spectrum sensing
          application in Cognitive Radios. Universal sequential hypothesis testing using Lempel Ziv codes and
          Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator
          with Arithmetic Encoder are considered and compared for different distributions. Cooperative spectrum sensing
          with multiple Cognitive Radios using universal codes is also considered.

          This paper considers sequential hypothesis testing in a decentralized framework. We start with two simple
          decentralized sequential hypothesis testing algorithms. One of which is later proved to be asymptotically
          Bayes optimal. We also consider composite
          versions of decentralized sequential hypothesis testing. A novel nonparametric version for decentralized
          sequential hypothesis testing using universal source coding theory is developed. Finally we design a simple
          decentralized
          multihypothesis sequential detection algorithm.

          This paper considers cooperative spectrum sensing in Cognitive Radios. In our previous work we have developed
          DualSPRT, a distributed algorithm for cooperative spectrum sensing using Sequential Probability Ratio Test
          (SPRT) at the Cognitive Radios as
          well as at the fusion center. This algorithm works well, but is not optimal. In this paper we propose an
          improved algorithm- SPRT-CSPRT, which is motivated from Cumulative Sum Procedures (CUSUM). We analyse it
          theoretically. We
          also modify this algorithm to handle uncertainties in SNR’s and fading.

          We consider cooperative spectrum sensing for cognitive radios. We develop an energy efficient detector with
          low detection delay using sequential hypothesis testing. Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) is used at
          both the local nodes and the fusion
          center. We also analyse the performance of this algorithm and compare with the simulations. Modelling
          uncertainties in the distribution parameters are considered. Slow fading with and without perfect channel
          state information at
          the cognitive radios is taken into account.
