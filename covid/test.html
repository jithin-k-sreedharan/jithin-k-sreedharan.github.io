                 are working on epidemiological models
                    and predictions of spread of Covid-19 infection, the impact of social distancing guidelines,
                    and providing guidance for policy-making. These efforts are aimed at understanding the
                    current state of the epidemic (is it waxing or waning?), estimating the state in the future (its
                    expected progression under different policy scenarios), and impact of various interventions
                    (e.g., reopening workplaces, schools, etc.)

<p>
Models are only as good as the data used to construct them. To this end, the CSoI team incorporates disparate data to fundamentally enhance the predictive accuracy of the models. Working with data from Facebook, mobility data across counties is being incorporated into new models. This data allows one to assess the impact of stay-at-home guidelines, as well as best approaches to relax these guidelines.
<!-- With availability of data at increasingly refined scales (e.g., data on movement across campus buildings), they are building fine-grained models for controlled activities that minimize risk of subsequent spread.  -->
<!-- The ability to accurately scale models from the entire country down to individual buildings allows decision-making at various levels, and to assess the integrated impact of these decisions at coarser levels. -->

          <h4 class="media-heading text-left" >Estimation of reproductive number</h4>
          <p>(Last data update: R<sub>o</sub> estimation and infections prediction - 4/27)<p>
         <p>
A useful indicator of the current state of the epidemic is the basic reproduction number (also sometimes referred to as the basic reproduction ratio). Typically represented by R<sub>o</sub> (pronounced R-nought), this number is the <i> average number of individuals infected by each infected individual </i>. One may observe that a value of R<sub>o</sub> greater than 1 corresponds to a spreading infection, R<sub>o</sub> less than 1 corresponds to a waning infection, and R<sub>o</sub> equal to one corresponds to a stable infected count.
</p>
<p>
Estimating R<sub>o</sub>, though, is hard because of sparse observational data, uncertainty associated with population parameters, and variability in responses to exposure and infection. Work at CSoI has focused not just on estimating values of R<sub>o</sub>, but also on characterizing the uncertainty associated with the value due to estimated uncertainty of population parameters. By building models for each county, these results clearly demonstrate the conformance and effectiveness of social distancing. An important aspect of this work is its use of novel computation techniques to estimate parameters for counties with sparse case reporting.
</p>
<p>
The R<sub>o</sub> value for various counties in Indiana has emerged from one indicating a spike in infections (or more tests conducted) in Indiana, although, there is a band of uncertainty around these values.

            values of R<sub>o</sub> for various counties in Indiana) for each county, these results clearly demonstrate

            its use of novel imputation techniques to estimate parameters for counties with sparse case
            reporting. These results indicate that the R<sub>o</sub> value for various counties in Indiana is now less
            than one, although, there is a band of uncertainty around this value that potentially takes it
            above one. Overall, the R<sub>o</sub> value for the state of Indiana as a whole is now trending to one,
            and lower, indicating that the peak of infection is near, due to the lag from time of infection to
            time of testing/ hospitalization. These results present a clear picture of the state of the epidemic
            in various county -- of particular note are counties like Lake County, where the value or R<sub>o</sub> is
            still significantly greater than one. -->
